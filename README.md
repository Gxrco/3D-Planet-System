# Solar System Simulator

A sophisticated 3D solar system simulator with realistic planetary orbits and interactive navigation features. Let's navigate with the ship and explore the system.

## Features

### Navigation Controls
- WASD Keys: 3D camera movement
- Arrow Keys: Orbit around current focus point
- R Key: Reset camera to initial position
- B Key: Toggle bird's eye view of the entire system
- Tab Key: Toggle ship view mode

### Warp System
- F1-F8 Keys: Instant warp to different celestial bodies
  - F1: Sun
  - F2: Mercury
  - F3: Venus
  - F4: Earth
  - F5: Mars
  - F6: Jupiter
  - F7: Saturn
  - F8: Moon
- Features animated portal effect during warping

### Visualization Features
- Realistic planet orbits with persistent trail visualization
- Dynamic skybox with star field
- Normal mapping on planet surfaces for enhanced detail
- Collision detection prevents camera/ship from intersecting with planets
- Custom-modeled spacecraft that follows camera in ship mode

### Planet Visibility Controls
- Number Keys (1-8): Toggle visibility of corresponding celestial bodies
  1: Sun
  2: Mercury
  3: Venus
